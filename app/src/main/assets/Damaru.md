# DAMARU

A damaru (Sanskrit: डमरु, IAST: ḍamaru; Tibetan ཌ་མ་རུ) is a small two-headed drum, used in Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism. In Hinduism, the damaru is known as the instrument of the deity Shiva, associated with Tantric traditions. It is said to be created by Shiva to produce spiritual sounds by which the whole universe has been created and regulated. In Tibetan Buddhism, the damaru is used as an instrument in meditation practices.

## Origin

Siva, Hindu Lord of destruction, regeneration and mythic inventor of drums, plays the damaru when he appears as Natesa, Lord of Dancers. He twists the hourglass-shaped drum causing pellets, attached by strings at its waist, to strike the skin heads which cover each end.

## Construction

The drum is typically made of wood, metal with leather drum heads at both ends. The resonator is made of brass. The height of the damaru is 6 inches and weight varies from 250-330 gm.[5] Its height ranges from a few inches to a little over one foot. It is played single-handedly. The strikers are typically beads fastened to the ends of leather cords around the waist of the damaru. Knots in the leather can also be used as strikers; crocheted material is also common. As the player waves the drum using a twisting wrist motion, the strikers beat on the drumhead.
