# DHOLAK

The dholak(Nepali:ढोलक) is a two-headed hand drum, a folk percussion instrument.It is a kind of large drum like a Madal made of a hollow wood by stretching leather over both of the edges and played with hands. This is mainly played in Madhesh. This is also a kind of Mridangan. Dholak is played throughout Nepal especially in Holi, and to celebrate birth of child and to welcome harvesting.

## Origin

Dholak has an ethinic connection with Kapali(one of the caste of Newar community).It is said to be originated from the Northen part of Ancient India.This is mainly played in Madhesh. This is also a kind of Mridangan.

## Construction

The instrument is about 45 cm in length and 27 cm in breadth. The smaller surface of the dholak is made of goat skin for sharp notes and the bigger surface is made of buffalo skin for low pitches, which allows a combination of bass and treble with rhythmic high and low pitches. The drum has two different sized drumheads. The smaller drumhead is made of goat skin for sharp notes while the bigger drumhead is made of buffalo skin for low pitch. The two drumheads allow a combination of bass and treble with rhythmic high and low pitches. The body or shell of the Dholak is made of sheesham or mango wood. The larger membrane, played with a stick, has a compound (Syahi) applied which helps to lower the pitch and produce the sound. The smaller drumhead is played with the left hand which produces a high pitch. A cotton rope lacing and screw-turnbuckle are used to release tension while playing. Steel rings/pegs are twisted inside the laces to attain fine tuning.
