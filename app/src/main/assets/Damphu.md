# Damphu

A damphu, or damfoo (Nepali: डम्फु), is a percussion instrument similar to a large tambourine. This instrument is used by the Tamang people of Nepal to play the melodious Tamang Selo.The Damphu and Tungna are the main instrument of the Tamang people and these two instruments are said to be the 'nail and flesh' on a finger.

## Origin

Many stories exist in the Tamang community about how the drum was first made and became an accompaniment to Tamang songs. It is said Peng Dorje once killed a particularly beautiful deer which deeply saddened his wife and was in tears so and Peng Dorje decided to cheer her up. He created the drum using the deer beautiful skin. First, he bought a strip of wood and made a circle. Then he tightened the dried deerskin on one side of the circle, using 32 bamboo sticks called phurba. The circle created melodious sounds, trak dhin. He started to sing, remembering his ancestors and gods with the beat of that new-born instrument. The story goes that all creatures danced to it, as did his wife. A bird, the pheasant "Danphe", was also dancing to the melody. So Peng Dorje named the circle drum, "Damphu". 

## Construction

This stick is made of a thin piece of bamboo. The skin is tightened and held in place by 32 bamboo pegs. These 32 pegs represent the Buddha and Bodhisattvas or Buddha's 32 physical symbols (lakshanas). Sometimes it has a mobile metal or wooden bird attached representing the mythical eponymous bird.
