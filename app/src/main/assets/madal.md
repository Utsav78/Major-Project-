# MADAL

Madal (Nepali: **मादल**)or **maadal** is a Nepalese folk musical instrument. The madal is used mainly for rhythm-keeping in Nepalese folk music. It is very popular and widely used as a **hand drum** in Nepal. Madal consists of a cylindrical body with a slight bulge at its center and heads at both ends, one head larger than the other. It is usually played horizontally in a seated position, with both heads played simultaneously.

## Origin

The madal originated in the Magar community of Nepal. The ancient name of madal is said to be originated from the word *mardal* (Nepali: मर्दल)

## Construction

Typically, a wooden log is carved so as to form a hollow cavity, called *ghar* (Nepali: घर). The heads of the drum are made of double-layered goat skins, and a black paste made of flour, iron filings, and egg is burned in to a circular area in the center of each head. This circle adds weight to the head and significantly alters the sound of the drum, giving it a bell-like quality. The heads are fixed to the body of the drum by leather strips running the length of the body, and an additional loose strip of leather which can be looped behind the performer's knees while playing. The larger and smaller heads are often referred to as male and female respectively.
