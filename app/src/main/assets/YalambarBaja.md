The dimensions are based upon the piece of bamboo chosen, approximately 45 cm. long x 13 to 20 cm. diameter. In the center on one side a rectangular hole is cut, approximately 7.5cm x 2 cm. large. On either side of the hole, a strip of bamboo of bamboo is cut to create a string or "choyaa." Each string is lifted and small pieces of bamboo are placed underneath the string on each end to act as bridges.
