# SANAI

The sanai is a musical instrument, originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is made of wood, with a double reed at one end and a metal or wooden flared bell at the other end. Its sound is thought to create and maintain a sense of auspiciousness and sanctity and as a result, is widely used during marriages, processions and in temples although it is also played in concerts.


## Origin

The sanai is thought to have been developed by improving upon the pungi (a woodwind folk instrument used primarily for snake charming).Another theory of the origin of the shehnai is that the name is a modification of the word "shah-nai". The word nai(circular reference) is used in many Indian/Nepali languages to mean barber. The word "shah" refers to a Royal. Since it was first played in the Shah's chambers and was played by a nai (barber), the instrument was named "sanai".

## Construction

The sanai is made of wood, except for a flaring metal bell attached to the bottom of the instrument, and measures about 12–20 inches (30–50 cm) in length, with six to eight keyless finger holes along its body.It is made of wood, with a double reed at one end and a metal or wooden flared bell at the other end.
