# EkTare

Ektare(Nepali) literally 'one-string', also called ) is a one-stringed musical instrument used in the traditional music of Nepal and South Asia as Ektara and used in modern-day music of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.The ektara is commonly used in kirtan chanting, a Hindu devotional practice of singing the divine names and mantras in an ecstatic call and response format.


## Origin

In origin the ektara was a regular string instrument of wandering bards and minstrels from Nepal and is plucked with one finger.  It is used in parts of India and Nepal today by Yogis and wandering holy men to accompany their singing and prayers. In Nepal, the instrument accompanies the singing of the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

## Construction

The ektara is a drone lute consisting of a gourd resonator covered with skin, through which a bamboo neck is inserted.A bamboo stick (90 cm long) is inserted through the side of a wooden bowl (called a "tumbo") and the top of the bowl is covered with deerskin. The instrument has a single string running from a peg at the top, down the length of the stick-neck, across a bridge on the deerhide soundboard, and is tied at the "spike" where the stick pokes through the bowl. The instrument's string is plucked with the musician's index fingernail.

- #### Musical Performance
> The ektārā player holds his instrument upright, gripping the neck just above the resonator and plucking the playing string or strings with the index finger of the same hand. If he is dancing, he supports the gourd resonator with his other hand, in which he carries clusters of small bells which sound as he beats his hand against the gourd. Pressing the two halves of the neck together loosens the string, thus lowering its pitch. The modulation of the tone with each slight flexing of the neck gives the ektara its distinctive sound.
