# JHYALI

Jhyali (Nepali: झ्याली) is a traditional folk percussion instrument from Nepal.These instruments have blended together when Nepali people have reported on what instruments to include in the Panche baja.


## Origin

The history of Panche Baja(Jhyali) in Nepal cannot be clearly ascertained as there are no historical facts suggesting the entrance or origination of Panche Baja in Nepal.Miss Carol Tingey, the author of “Heartbeat of Nepal: The Pancai Baja”, claims that Panche Baja probably arrived in Nepal with the Rajput refugees during the fourteenth century.

## Construction

They are thinly walled, consist of a pair of round, metal plates, resembling cymbals,[1] and are used in both folk and classical music in Nepal. Unlike most percussion instruments around the world, the Jhyali is played by rubbing the plates with the right hand rising and the left hand descending at the time when they clash.
These percussion instruments are made by a Nepali alloy that is called pancha dhatu, which means five metals. The alloy consists of brass, copper, silver, zinc and gold, and are usually made by blacksmiths.
