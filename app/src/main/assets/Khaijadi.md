# KHAIJADI

Khaijadi (Nepali: खैंजडी) is a traditional musical instrument of Nepal made by wood and skin of iguanas. The instrument is used by different ethnic groups of Nepal in special dances and occasions.


## Origin

There are no such evidence of origin and creation of the instrument Khaijadi.But are often used in the accompaniment of dances known as chudka and kauda, which are performed by members of the Magar, Gurung, and other indigenous communities in Mid-Western Nepal during social activities.

## Construction

Similar to the Western tambourine, it consists of a circular frame made of the wood of the jackfruit tree, between 7 and 9 inches in width and 2 to 4 inches in depth. It is covered on one side with a drumhead made of monitor lizard skin (specifically the Bengal monitor, Varanus bengalensis, now an endangered species in India), while the other side is left open. The traditional lizard skin is prohibited worldwide due to protection of species regulations. Even well-known Kanjira players, however, attest to the great advantages of using goat skin as an alternative. After playing for a while, the goat skin gets more and more flexible and offers a wider range of possible modulations. The frame has a single slit which contain three to four small metal discs (often old coins) that jingle when the kanjira is played.

- #### Playing Technique
> The kanjira is a relatively difficult Indian drum to play, especially in South Indian Carnatic music, for reasons including the complexity of the percussion patterns used in Indian music. It is normally played with the palm and fingers of the right hand, while the left hand supports the drum. The fingertips of the left hand can be used to bend the pitch by applying pressure near the outer rim. It is not tuned to any particular pitch, unlike the mridangam or the ghatam.
Normally, without tuning, it has a very high pitched sound. To get a good bass sound, the performer reduces the tension of the drumhead by sprinkling water on the inside of the instrument.This process may have to be repeated during a concert to maintain a good sound. However, if the instrument is too moist, it will have a dead tone, requiring 5–10 minutes to dry. Tone is also affected by external temperature and moisture conditions. Performers typically carry a couple of kanjiras so that they can keep at least one in perfectly tuned condition at any given time.
- #### Price Range 
> A typical Khaijadi instrument ranges from NRs.2500-4000.
