# BANSURI

A bansuri (Nepali: बाँसुरी) is a side blown flute originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is an aerophone produced from bamboo, used in Hindustani classical music. It is referred to as nadi and tunava in the Rigveda and other Vedic texts of Hinduism.Its importance and operation is discussed in the Sanskrit text Natya Shastra.


## Origin

Flute is a simple instrument found in numerous ancient cultures. According to legends the three birthplaces of flutes are Egypt, Greece, Ancient India(Now: India and Nepal).The flute is discussed as an important musical instrument in the Natya Shastra (~200 BCE to 200 CE), the classic Sanskrit text on music and performance arts. The flute (Venu or Vamsa) is mentioned in many Hindu texts on music and singing, as complementary to the human sound and Veena (vaani-veena-venu).The flute is however not called bansuri in the ancient, and is referred to by other names such as nadi, tunava in the Rigveda (1500–1200 BCE) and other Vedic texts of Hinduism, or as venu in post-Vedic texts.The flute is also mentioned in various Upanishads and Yoga texts.

## Construction

A bansuri is traditionally made from a single hollow shaft of bamboo with six or seven finger holes. Some modern designs come in ivory, fiberglass and various metals. The six hole instrument covers two and a half octaves of music. The bansuri is typically between 30 centimetres (12 in) and 75 centimetres (30 in) in length, and the thickness of a human thumb. One end is closed, and few centimeters from the closed end is its blow hole. Longer bansuris feature deeper tones and lower pitches. The traditional design features no mechanical keys, and the musician creates the notes they want by tapping the various finger holes.
