# Dhimay

Dhimay, Dhimaya (Newar: धिमय्) or Dhime (धिमे) is a drum, and according to the Sachs-Hornbostel classification belongs to the category of double-headed cylindrical membranophone.


## Origin

According to local legends, the instrument is believed to be invented by Mahadev. The drum has been played since the Kirata kingdom. The drum is played mostly by Jyapu community. However, Shresthas, Ranjitkars and other castes also play it.

## Construction

The drum is rather big compared to other drums played by the Newars in Nepal. The size of this instrument varies from diameter of 40 inches to 51 inches and length of 17 inches to 21 inches. The shell of the drum is made of wood or metal. Sometimes wooden drums are partly covered with metal foil. The shape of old Dhimay drums is mostly irregular, formed by the natural shape of the piece of wood being used to make the drum body (see image at the mimo-db). Modern drums are either cylindrical or slightly barrel-shaped. Both heads are made of goat skin. On the inside of the left membrane, called Mankhah (Haima in Bhaktapur) a red tuning paste (similar in function to the Syahi) is applicated, providing a deep sound.
