# SANKHA

Shankh is a wind instrument made of a conch shell. Used in religious ceremonies. An instrument with limited musical applications, Shankh is considered to be of immense religious importance in Hinduism.In Hindu mythology, the shankha is a sacred emblem of the Hindu preserver god Vishnu. It is still used as a trumpet in Hindu ritual, and in the past was used as a war trumpet. The shankha is praised in Hindu scriptures as a giver of fame, longevity and prosperity, the cleanser of sin and the abode of Lakshmi, who is the goddess of wealth and consort of Vishnu.


## Origin

It is widely believed that the first use of the Shankha took place during the Samudra Manthan or churning of the ocean. Legends have it that it was used and remained an object of benefaction during Samudra Manthan. Shankha is closely associated with Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi. Lord Vishnu is usually portrayed holding a conch shell. It is believed that during the Samudra Manthan, the first conch shell appeared, and Goddess Lakshmi followed it.

## Construction

It is made up from the shell of a large predatory sea snail particularly found in the Indian Ocean. Air is blown with very high pressure through the outer hole and passes through a tiny hole inside the Shankh. The air resonates through the inner wall of the Shankh and the sound is produced when air passes through the lower opening.
