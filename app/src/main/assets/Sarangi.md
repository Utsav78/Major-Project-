It has also garnered much interest in other music genres, such as Nepali rock and film music.

While the upper chamber is left open, the lower opening, upon which the bridge rests, is generally covered up with dried skin of sheep or goat. The neck is fretless, and the strings are tied upon and tuned with the tuning pegs. The size of Sarangi differs according to the players' preference.The Nepali Sarangi consists of four strings. The original strings were made up of sheep intestine, similar to the use of catgut (made from the intestines of cattle) in many musical traditions around the world
