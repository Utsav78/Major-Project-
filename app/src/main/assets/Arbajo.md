The aarbajo (Nepali: आरबाजो) is a Nepali four-string lute used as a rhythm instrument (Tālabājā (Nepali: तालबाजा)). It is the traditional instrument of the Gandarbha caste of musical performers, and is considered a companion to the Nepali sarangi.The Gandarbhas consider the aarbajo to be the "male instrument", the sarangi the "female.The aarbajo is used less than in the past, and been replaced by the sarangi, which was considered in 1999 to have superseded the aarbajo in common use.
